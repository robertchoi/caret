# Caret Development Guide

Caret is a VSCode extension based on Cline. This guide contains all the information developers need to contribute to the project.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Architecture

### Fork-Based Structure

Caret is a complete Fork of [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline):

-   **`src/`**: Cline original code (preserved as much as possible)
-   **`caret-src/`**: Caret unique extension features (minimized)
-   **`webview-ui/`**: React frontend (utilizes Cline build system)

For detailed architecture information, refer to the [Caret Architecture Guide](./caret-architecture-and-implementation-guide.en.mdx).

### ‚ö° Frontend-Backend Interaction Patterns

Use **proven standard patterns** for communication between Caret's webview and Extension Host:

-   **Single Field Update**: Send only changed fields to prevent circular messages.
-   **Optimistic Update**: Immediately update UI, then synchronize with backend.
-   **Separate Update Functions**: Create dedicated functions like `setUILanguage`, `setPersona`, etc.

For detailed patterns, refer to the [Frontend-Backend Interaction Guide](./frontend-backend-interaction-patterns.en.mdx).

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js 18+
-   npm or yarn
-   VSCode (for development and testing)
-   Git

### Installation and Execution

1.  **Clone Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/aicoding-caret/caret.git
    cd caret
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    cd webview-ui && npm install && cd ..
    ```

3.  **Compile Protocol Buffers**

    ```bash
    npm run protos
    ```

4.  **Compile TypeScript**

    ```bash
    npm run compile
    # Or for quick development
    npm run compile:fast
    ```

5.  **Run Extension (Development Mode)**
    - Press F5 in VSCode or Debug > Start Debugging.
    - A new VSCode window will open with the Caret extension activated.

## üß™ Testing

Caret aims for **100% test coverage** (based on Caret-specific code) and **TDD (Test-Driven Development)**, and all code must pass all tests before pushing.

### Test Framework

Caret uses **Vitest** to manage both frontend and backend tests.

### Key Test Commands

```bash
# ‚≠ê Recommended: Run all tests (frontend + backend)
# You must run this command to ensure all tests pass before pushing to Git.
npm run test:all

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Caution: Command with past ESM-related issues
# Currently behaves the same as 'npm run test:all' and all tests pass.
# However, 'npm run test:all' is still recommended as a priority.
npm test

# Run individual tests (refer to Testing Guide for details)
npm run test:backend    # Backend only
npm run test:webview    # Frontend only (Webview UI)

# Test watch mode (during development)
npm run test:backend:watch # Backend watch
# npm run test:webview:watch # Frontend watch (add to package.json if needed)
```

### Test Execution Flow and Principles

1.  **During Development**: When changes occur, frequently run `npm run test:all` or related individual tests (`test:backend`, `test:webview`) to get immediate feedback.
2.  **Before Commit and Push**: **You must run `npm run compile && npm run test:all`** to ensure all builds succeed and all tests pass.
    -   **Principle**: If even a single test fails, do not push the code until the root cause is resolved.
3.  **CI/CD**: `npm run test:all` will be automatically executed for pushed code via GitHub Actions to verify quality. (Planned for future implementation)

For detailed testing strategies, test writing methods, and various test command options, please refer to the **[Caret Testing Guide](./testing-guide.en.mdx)** document. This guide provides the most detailed and accurate information regarding testing.

### Check Test Coverage

```bash
# Check overall coverage (integrated backend + frontend coverage may require further configuration review)
npm run test:coverage # May primarily indicate backend coverage

# Detailed analysis of Caret-specific code coverage (utilize script)
node caret-scripts/caret-coverage-check.js
```

For more details, refer to the coverage section of the [Testing Guide](./testing-guide.en.mdx).

## üèóÔ∏è Build System

### Key Build Commands

```bash
# Compile Protocol Buffers (for gRPC communication)
npm run protos

# Compile TypeScript (backend) - includes full verification
npm run compile

# Fast compile (for quick builds during development)
npm run compile:fast

# Build Webview UI (frontend)
cd webview-ui
npm run build

# Create VSIX package
npm run package

# Create VSIX release package (includes timestamp)
npm run package:release

# Watch mode for development
npm run watch
```

### Detailed Explanation of Build Commands

#### `npm run compile`

-   **Full Build**: Type check + linting + compilation
-   **Usage**: Before PR submission, final check before deployment
-   **Time**: Relatively long (full verification)

#### `npm run compile:fast`

-   **Fast Build**: Only compilation (skips verification)
-   **Usage**: Quick tests during development, iterative development
-   **Time**: Very fast (1-2 seconds)

### Cline Pattern-Based Build Optimization

-   **Protocol Buffer**: Protobuf compilation for MCP server communication.
-   **esbuild**: Fast TypeScript bundling.
-   **Vite**: React component build and HMR.

## üîß Development Workflow

### 1. New Feature Development (Utilizing Cline Patterns)

#### Backend Extension

```typescript
// caret-src/core/feature/NewFeature.ts
import { WebviewProvider } from "../../../src/core/webview/WebviewProvider"

export class NewFeature extends WebviewProvider {
	// Extend Cline functionality
	override async handleRequest(request: any) {
		// Caret-specific logic
		const caretResult = await this.processCaretSpecific(request)

		// Combine with Cline's default processing
		const baseResult = await super.handleRequest(request)

		return { ...baseResult, ...caretResult }
	}
}
```

#### Frontend Extension

```typescript
// webview-ui/src/caret/components/NewComponent.tsx
import React from 'react'
import { useExtensionState } from '../../context/ExtensionStateContext'

export const NewComponent: React.FC = () => {
  const { state } = useExtensionState()

  return (
    <div className="caret-new-component">
      {/* Caret-specific UI */}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### 2. Utilizing Task Execution System

Extending Cline's proven Task execution pattern:

```typescript
// caret-src/core/task/CaretTask.ts
import { Task } from "../../../src/core/task/Task"

export class CaretTask extends Task {
	async initiateTaskLoop(userContent: UserContent, isNewTask: boolean) {
		while (!this.abort) {
			// 1. API Streaming (Cline Pattern)
			const stream = this.attemptApiRequest()

			// 2. Real-time message processing (Cline Pattern)
			for await (const chunk of stream) {
				await this.handleStreamingChunk(chunk)
			}

			// 3. Add Caret-specific processing
			await this.processCaretSpecificTasks()
		}
	}
}
```

### 3. State Management (Cline Pattern)

```typescript
// caret-src/core/state/CaretStateManager.ts
export class CaretStateManager {
	async initializeState() {
		// Global State (shared across all VSCode instances)
		const globalSettings = await this.context.globalState.get("caret.settings")

		// Workspace State (current workspace)
		const workspaceData = await this.context.workspaceState.get("caret.workspace")

		// Secrets (secure storage)
		const apiKeys = await this.context.secrets.get("caret.apiKeys")
	}
}
```

## üìù Documentation

### Code Documentation

-   **TSDoc**: TSDoc comments for all public methods.
-   **README**: Write README for each package/module.
-   **Architecture**: Document key design decisions.

````typescript
/**
 * Main class for processing Caret-specific features
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * const caret = new CaretProvider()
 * await caret.initialize()
 * ```
 */
export class CaretProvider extends WebviewProvider {
	/**
	 * Processes Caret-specific messages
	 * @param message - Message object to process
	 * @returns Promise of processing result
	 */
	async handleCaretMessage(message: CaretMessage): Promise<CaretResponse> {
		// Implementation...
	}
}
````

### Document Writing Guide

All documents should be written following the [Document Writing Guide](./documentation-guide.en.mdx).

## üîç Debugging

### VSCode Extension Debugging

1.  **F5** or **Run > Start Debugging**.
2.  Test extension in a new VSCode window.
3.  Debug webview in **Developer Tools**.
4.  Check logs in **Output** panel.

### Logging System (Extending Cline Patterns)

```typescript
// caret-src/utils/caret-logger.ts
import { Logger } from "../../src/services/logging/Logger"

export class CaretLogger extends Logger {
	constructor(name: string) {
		super(`Caret.${name}`)
	}

	logWithContext(level: LogLevel, message: string, context?: any) {
		const caretContext = {
			...context,
			caretVersion: this.getCaretVersion(),
			timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
		}

		super.log(level, message, caretContext)
	}
}

// Usage example
const logger = new CaretLogger("FeatureName")
logger.logWithContext("info", "Feature initialized", { feature: "newFeature" })
```

For detailed logging guide, refer to the [Logging Guide](./logging.en.mdx).

## üéØ Quality Assurance

### Code Quality

-   **ESLint**: Code style and quality checks.
-   **Prettier**: Code formatting.
-   **TypeScript**: Strict type checking.

```bash
# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run formatting
npm run format

# Run type checking (includes Protocol Buffer)
npm run check-types

# Command combination for fast development
npm run compile:fast  # Fast compile (skips type check + linting)
npm run compile       # Full compile (includes all verifications)
```

### Development Efficiency Tips

#### Fast Development Cycle

```bash
# 1. Quick check after code modification
npm run compile:fast

# 2. Check test status
npm run test:all

# 3. Final verification (before PR submission)
npm run compile && npm run test:all
# Note: npm test currently fails due to ESM/CJS issues, so use test:all
```

#### Utilize Watch Mode

```bash
# Automatic compile in background
npm run watch

# Test watch in separate terminal
npm run test:backend:watch
```

### Commit Convention

```
feat: Add new feature
fix: Fix bug
docs: Document changes
style: Code formatting
refactor: Code refactoring
test: Test code
chore: Build/configuration changes
```
