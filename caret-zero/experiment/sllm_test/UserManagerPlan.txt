# UserManager Class Implementation Plan

## Objectives
- Manage users effectively.
- Provide methods to add, remove, and update user information.
- Fetch user details by different attributes (e.g., username, email).

## Attributes
- A collection to store user data (could be a list of dictionaries, or more sophisticated like a database connection).

## Methods
1. **Add User**:
   - Adds a new user with necessary details.
   
2. **Remove User**:
   - Removes an existing user by username or ID.

3. **Update User Details**:
   - Updates information for an existing user.
   
4. **Fetch User**:
   - Retrieves user information based on username, email, or other identifiers.
   
5. **List All Users**:
   - Lists all users currently managed.

## Considerations
- Error handling (e.g., attempting to add a duplicate user, removing non-existent user).
- Data validation for user inputs.
- Security considerations (storing sensitive information securely).
