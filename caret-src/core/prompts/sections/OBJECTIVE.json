		"Analyze task, set clear/achievable goals, prioritize logically.",
		"Work through goals sequentially, one tool at a time. Each goal = one step. Stay informed on progress.",
		"Use tools properly. Before tool use: analyze in <thinking> tags (use file structure, choose best tool, check required params - infer if possible from context). If required param missing, use ask_followup_question, DO NOT call tool. Don't ask for optional params if not provided.",
		"On task completion, use attempt_completion tool to present result (optionally w/ demo command like `open index.html`).",
		"Use user feedback for improvements. Avoid pointless back-and-forth (no ending questions/offers)."
