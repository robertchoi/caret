> **Caret** 이름의 유래: 프로그래밍에서 위치와 방향을 나타내는 '^' (caret) 기호에서 따온 이름입니다.

## What Makes Caret Special

While Caret includes all of Cline's core functionality—reading/writing files, executing commands, using your web browser, and expanding capabilities with Model Context Protocol servers—it adds several unique features:

### 🎭 AI Persona System

Choose from pre-defined AI assistant personalities, each with unique communication styles and expertise areas:

-   **오사랑 (Oh Sarang)** - K-pop idol with mathematical emotion analysis
-   **마도베 이치카 (Madobe Ichika)** - Windows 11-inspired, organized assistant
-   **사이안 매킨 (Cyan Mackin)** - macOS-inspired, minimalist efficiency
-   **탄도 우분투 (Thando Ubuntu)** - Ubuntu-inspired, open-source collaboration

### ⚡ Smart Rule Management

Intelligent rule priority system that prevents duplicate configurations:

-   **Priority Logic**: `.clinerules` > `.cursorrules` > `.windsurfrules`
-   **Conflict Prevention**: Only one rule type loads at a time
-   **Token Optimization**: Eliminates redundant instructions

### 🧪 Enhanced Testing System

Improved test framework with better organization:

-   **Vitest Integration**: Modern testing with better performance
-   **Clear Command Structure**: Intuitive test commands
-   **Comprehensive Coverage**: Dedicated test suites for Caret features

## Caret's Philosophy

Caret embraces the same thoughtful approach to code generation as Cline but adds personality and efficiency improvements. Rather than just generating code, Caret:

-   **Collaborates with Character**: Choose an AI personality that matches your working style
-   **Prevents Configuration Conflicts**: Smart rule management eliminates duplicate settings
-   **Maintains Cline Compatibility**: All Cline features work seamlessly
-   **Adds Korean Language Support**: Enhanced multilingual capabilities
