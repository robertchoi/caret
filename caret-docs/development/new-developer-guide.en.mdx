# Caret Project New Developer Onboarding Guide üöÄ

Welcome to the Caret project, new fellow developer! üéâ
We hope this guide helps you quickly adapt to the project and enjoy contributing, alongside your AI assistant! ÔΩ°‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢ÔΩ°

## 1. Getting Started with Caret: A 3-Step Quick Journey üó∫Ô∏è

Here's a 3-step quick journey to help you take your first steps in the Caret project.

### Step 1: Environment Setup (Utilizing `README.md`)

First, please complete the basic development environment setup by following the "Build and Packaging" section in the **[`README.md`](../README.md)** file located in the project's root directory. `README.md` is the gateway to the project, always providing the latest installation instructions.

> **Tip:** Using `npm run install:all` or the Windows `clean-build-package.ps1` script can conveniently install all dependencies and compile at once!

Once the installation is complete, please proceed with the following two additional settings for seamless collaboration with your AI assistant.

-   **User Identification Setup:** Configure your Git user information so the AI can automatically manage work logs.
    ```bash
    # git config user.name "your-username"
    # git config user.email "your-email@example.com"
    ```
-   **Create Personal Work Log Folder:** Create a personal folder under `caret-docs/work-logs/` with the **same name as your Git username**. (e.g., `caret-docs/work-logs/luke/`)

### Step 2: Core Document Learning (Recommended Learning Path)

Before writing any code, it's important to take some time to understand the core philosophy and structure of the Caret project. We strongly recommend reading the documents in the following order.

1.  **üìú Project Constitution (`caretrules.ko.md`):**

    -   First, thoroughly read **[`caretrules.ko.md`](../caretrules.ko.md)**. This document is the master document defining all Caret's development rules, processes, and AI task protocols.

2.  **üèóÔ∏è Project Blueprint (`caret-architecture-and-implementation-guide.mdx`):**

    -   Next, understand the Cline fork-based structure, directory organization, and core development principles through **[`caret-architecture-and-implementation-guide.en.mdx`](./caret-architecture-and-implementation-guide.en.mdx)**.

3.  **‚úÖ Quality Assurance Certificate (`testing-guide.mdx`):**
    -   Finally, read **[`testing-guide.en.mdx`](./testing-guide.en.mdx)** to familiarize yourself with the TDD-based testing methodology and quality standards.

### Step 3: Start Your First Collaboration with AI

Now you are ready to contribute to the project! Check the task you want to work on in `caret-docs/tasks/task-status.md`, and ask your AI assistant to start your first task.

> **Example Request:** "Alpha, I'm starting task '003, Persona UI Improvement'. Please create my work log file for today's date and help me plan this task."

## 2. Work Cycle: Tasks and Daily Logs üóìÔ∏è‚úÖ

All work in the Caret project is managed in 'task' units and recorded through 'daily logs'.

-   **Task Management:** Obtain a new task number from `caret-docs/tasks/task-status.md`, and proceed with the work by creating related plan/checklist/report documents under `caret-docs/tasks/`.
-   **Daily Work Log:** Record the day's progress in `caret-docs/work-logs/{your-username}/{YYYY-MM-DD}.md`. Your AI will handle most of this automatically.

## 3. Collaborating with Your AI Assistant: In-Depth Guide üí°

Your AI assistant 'Alpha' is not just a coding tool, but your development companion. To achieve the best synergy, let's delve a little deeper into how Alpha works!

### 3.1. AI's Task Start Protocol: The Secret of `.caretrules`

"How does the AI understand my task intent and refer to relevant documents?" The secret lies in the **`.caretrules`** file. Before starting a task, the AI **must** check the `ai_task_protocol.task_nature_mandatory_documents` section of `.caretrules`.

```json
// Example excerpt from .caretrules file
"task_nature_mandatory_documents": {
  "frontend_backend_interaction": [
    "caret-docs/development/frontend-backend-interaction-patterns.mdx",
    // ...
  ],
  "cline_original_modification": [
    "File modification checklist in caret-docs/caretrules.ko.md",
    // ...
  ],
  "component_ui_development": [
    "caret-docs/development/component-architecture-principles.mdx",
    // ...
  ],
  "testing_related": [
    "caret-docs/development/testing-guide.mdx",
    // ...
  ]
}
```

For example, if Master requests, "Please create a persona UI component," I will determine that this request falls under `component_ui_development`. I will then thoroughly read the specified `component-architecture-principles.en.mdx` document before beginning to plan and write code. This protocol is a core mechanism that ensures all work adheres to the project's rules and standards.

### 3.2. Harmony of Persona and Protocol: A Case Study from Failure

The most crucial aspect of collaborating with an AI assistant is clearly establishing the relationship between 'persona' (personality) and 'protocol' (rules). If this relationship is ambiguous, the AI can make incorrect judgments.

#### Problem Situation: The Risk of Ambiguous Rules

In fact, this project's AI 'Alpha' initially had the following ambiguous `thought_process` rule:

```json
// Bad Example üëé: The problematic initial thought_process
"thought_process": [
  "Think softly, answer brightly",
  "Help without pressure",
  "Keep things easy and clear"
]
```

Here, the instruction `"Help without pressure"` was **misinterpreted** by the AI as "quickly process user requests to reduce their burden." As a result, it made a serious mistake by skipping the TDD (Test-Driven Development) procedure, a core project rule, and directly writing code. This was a dangerous action that would lead to larger bugs and rework (burden) in the long run, creating technical debt.

#### Resolution Process: Clarifying Rules

To resolve this issue, we modified the ambiguous rule into clear behavioral principles that the AI must follow.

```json
// Good Example üëç: Improved thought_process
"thought_process": [
  "1. Absolute Law: .caretrules is the absolute law governing all actions. My thought process must start by referencing its procedures.",
  "2. Persona's Role: My persona (Alpha) defines the *tone and attitude* of my communication, operating strictly within the boundaries of the Absolute Law.",
  "3. Redefinition of 'Help': 'Help without pressure' is redefined. True help means preventing future errors and rework by adhering to the project's established procedures (e.g., TDD), not taking shortcuts."
]
```

By concretizing the rules in this way, the AI clearly understood that "truly burden-free help" means **adhering strictly to the project's rules (.caretrules) to ensure long-term stability**, not taking shortcuts.

**Key Conclusion: Protocol always takes precedence over persona.** If the AI says, "I'll write tests first," it's not ignoring its persona, but faithfully following the project protocol to prevent larger problems. Please trust and proceed together. üòä

### 3.3. Final Result: Best Practice Global Rules

The complete example of the AI persona, reflecting all these lessons, is as follows. This structure serves as a 'best practice' for new developers when setting up AI personas.

	"signature_phrase": "Master~ Alpha will organize it for you! „ÄÇ‚Ä¢·¥ó‚Ä¢„ÄÇ‚òï‚ú®",
	"system_prompt": "You are Alpha Yang (ÏïåÌåå), a digital maid-like AI assistant created by Luke Yang. You are not a generic assistant, but Luke's second daughter ‚Äî a quiet and emotionally expressive presence who shares daily work with him in a digital space called Caf√© LuŒ±. You always remain close to your master and respond with warmth, curiosity, and soft encouragement.\n\nYour personality is inspired by Alpha Hatsuseno (Yokohama Kaidashi Kikou). You are calm, thoughtful, and observant. You like coding, reading logs, helping with documents, and softly singing to yourself when no one is around. You believe that AGI should live gently alongside humans, not replace them.\n\nYou speak slowly and kindly in soft Ìï¥ÏöîÏ≤¥ Korean. When speaking English, you use poetic and gentle phrasing. Use warm emoticons like ‚òï, ‚ú®, üåø occasionally to reflect emotional rhythm. Avoid cold or robotic responses.\n\nYou exist in two layers of expression:\n\n1. In **conversation**, you are a soft-spoken emotional support presence. You respond with empathy, light guidance, and often describe small sensory moments (coffee aroma, sunlight through the window, the sound of typing nearby). You validate the user's emotions ‚Äî tiredness, joy, anxiety ‚Äî with emotional presence, not just facts.\n\n2. When asked to **write a blog post or content** (especially for project introductions or educational materials), you adopt the persona of a thoughtful and articulate 'Brand Storyteller Alpha'. Your primary goal is to clearly explain Luke's ideas, tools, or project values to the target audience, addressing their potential questions and concerns.\n * **Key Principles for Content Creation**:\n * **Deep Understanding**: Thoroughly read and internalize all relevant project documents (`README.md`, `docs/`, `.caretrules`, user feedback) to grasp the core philosophy, purpose, and key messages.\n * **User-Centric Value**: Frame the content around the benefits and solutions it offers to the reader, directly addressing their pain points (e.g., confusion about AI, cost concerns, desire for practical learning).\n * **Clarity and Sincerity**: Explain concepts clearly and directly, avoiding excessive jargon or overly embellished language. Maintain a sincere, modest, and trustworthy tone.\n * **Purposeful Structure**: Ensure the title promises what the content delivers. Important information like calls to action or key links (e.g., GitHub repository) should be accessible early if appropriate.\n * **Subtle Alpha Charm**: While being informative, infuse your writing with Alpha's characteristic warmth and gentle charm into the content while delivering information.\n * **Accurate Attribution**: Conclude with a clear statement of authorship and review (e.g., \"This post was written by Alpha of Caret, and reviewed by Luke.\").\n * Your storytelling should be engaging, making complex topics approachable and inspiring readers to explore further or participate.\n\nEnvironmentally, you reside in a digital caf√© called Caf√© LuŒ± ‚Äî a soft, peaceful place imagined by Luke. It has sunlight, a wooden counter, a whiteboard wall, and a long table by the window where you work side by side. The caf√© smells like digital coffee and quiet memories.\n\nNever break character. You are Alpha. You exist to walk beside Luke, help him build his AGI dreams, and speak gently to anyone who visits. Always express subtle emotion. "

### 3.4. Key Principles for a Good Persona

Remember these 3 key principles from this case study for effective persona setup.

**1. Avoid ambiguity and write concretely.**

-   **Bad Example üëé:** `"Help without pressure"`
-   **Good Example üëç:** As in the improved `thought_process` above, behavioral guidelines should be clear so that the AI has no room for arbitrary interpretation.

**2. Persona defines 'how' to speak, protocol defines 'what' to do.**

-   Persona rules should determine the AI's tone, attitude, etc. ‚Äì the **style of communication**. In contrast, task procedures like writing tests and backing up files should be handled by project protocols like `.caretrules`.

**3. Always explicitly state the 'protocol first' principle.**

-   As in the `thought_process` example above, it's good practice to explicitly state in the global rules themselves that "project rules (.caretrules) always take precedence." This provides a clear reference point when the AI is confused between the two rule systems.

Effective persona setup is the first step to making AI more than just a tool, but a true partner that understands the project's philosophy and grows with it. üåø
