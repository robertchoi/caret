Caret is more than just an AI coding tool; it's a VS Code extension that aims to be an **AI companion that grows with developers**. It preserves the advantages of the proven open-source [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) while maximizing the development experience by 'overlaying' more powerful and flexible features.

## ✨ What makes Caret different?

| Feature | Cline | Cursor | **Caret** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **AI Behavior** | Plan/Act (Slightly unnatural) | Ask/Agent (Natural) | **Chatbot/Agent Mode (More intuitive & powerful)** |
| **AI Transparency** | ✅ Open Source (High) | ❌ Black Box (Low) | **✅ Open Source + Improved System Prompt (Very High)** |
| **Persona** | ❌ Not Supported | ❌ Not Supported | **✅ Template & Custom Persona, Profile Image Support** |
| **Multilingual Support** | ❌ Not Supported | ❌ Not Supported | **✅ Full Multilingual Support (i18n Overlay)** |
| **Architecture** | Core Features | Closed | **Overlay Structure (Stability + Extensibility)** |

### 1. More Natural Conversations with AI: Chatbot & Agent Mode
Going beyond Cline's somewhat rigid Plan/Act mode, Caret offers a more intuitive **Chatbot/Agent mode**, similar to Cursor's flexible Ask/Agent approach but with more intuitive terminology. Furthermore, it's not just about changing the behavior; our **independently improved system prompt** enhances both the AI's response performance and attitude, enabling smarter, more natural collaboration. This not only makes collaboration smarter and more natural but also reduces unnecessary token usage, leading to **API cost savings** and **improved cost predictability**.

### 2. Create Your Own AI Companion: Custom Personas

Add fun to your coding with pre-made **template personas** like Caret's default character, a K-POP idol, and OS-tans. You can create a visually vibrant development environment by registering your own AI agent name and **profile image**.

**Default Personas:**
*   <img src="caret-assets/template_characters/caret.png" width="24" align="center"/> **Caret**: A friendly robot friend who loves to code and help developers.
*   <img src="caret-assets/template_characters/sarang.png" width="24" align="center"/> **Oh Sarang**: A K-pop idol and tsundere engineering girl who helps you navigate between logic and emotion.
*   <img src="caret-assets/template_characters/ichika.png" width="24" align="center"/> **Madobe Ichika**: A neat and reliable assistant inspired by Windows 11.
*   <img src="caret-assets/template_characters/cyan.png" width="24" align="center"/> **Cyan Mackin**: A concise and efficient assistant inspired by macOS.
*   <img src="caret-assets/template_characters/ubuntu.png" width="24" align="center"/> **Thando Ubuntu**: A warm collaborator who solves problems together in the spirit of open source.

### 3. Coding Without Language Barriers: Full Multilingual Support
Caret addresses the multilingual support that other AI tools have overlooked. Through an **i18n-based overlay structure**, developers who are not comfortable with English can use all features seamlessly in their **native language, including Korean, Japanese, and Chinese**.

### 4. Stability and Extensibility at Once: Overlay Architecture
By preserving Cline's proven stable core and overlaying Caret's unique, innovative features, you can enjoy both **Cline's stability and transparency** and **Caret's powerful extensibility**.

## 🚀 Getting Started
